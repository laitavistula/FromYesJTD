## Process timeline for international documents

### Pre-marriage (start 6+ months in advance)
- Non-Polish partners must submit their documents (e.g., birth certificates, proof of identity, marital status confirmation) for translation into Polish and authentication (e.g., apostille or consular legalization).
- Begin gathering all required paperwork early to allow for longer processing times.

### Post-marriage – registration
- After the ceremony, the international couple must register their marriage at the local Register office (Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC).
- A fee is required for the issuance of the marriage certificate.
- Payment methods and additional fees should be confirmed directly with the USC.
