## Outdoor wedding

### Overview

- A formal request and standard documents are required.  
- Fees may apply for officiating at non-standard venues.  
- The location must meet legal standards for the ceremony.  
- Ensure that the Polish coat of arms is displayed at the location where the outdoor wedding ceremony takes place, as this is a requirement for the official proceedings.  
- Since 2015, outdoor weddings have been allowed in Poland at castles, parks, or gardens.
