## Common pitfalls

Common pitfalls for foreigners in the documentation process can include:

- **Documentation discrepancies:** To avoid discrepancies, ensure all documents are current and certified.
- **Translation errors:** Make sure to work with a certified/sworn translator (*tłumacz przysięgły*) and ensure all translations are accurate.
- **Legal validity of foreign documents:** Confirm any additional steps required for your country to recognize a Polish marriage certificate.
