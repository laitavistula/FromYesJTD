# Wedding checklist

The following checklist outlines the key legal and administrative steps to help you successfully navigate your wedding preparations.

### Core steps:
- [ ] Determine marriage type: decide on the type of ceremony (civil, church, concordat, ecumenical, humanist) as this dictates the required paperwork.
- [ ] Gather required documents: collect all necessary documents (ID, birth certificates, proof of previous marriage termination, etc.).
- [ ] Translate and authenticate: if any documents are foreign, ensure they are translated by a sworn translator (tłumacz przysięgły) and authenticated with an Apostille (if applicable).
- [ ] Apply at the USC: submit the application and required documents to the local Register Office (Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC).
- [ ] Fulfill the waiting period: be aware of the one-month waiting period after submitting the application before the marriage can take place.
- [ ] Attend the ceremony: hold the wedding ceremony according to the chosen type (civil, church, etc.).
- [ ] Register your marriage: ensure the marriage is officially registered (especially important for church or humanist ceremonies).

### Highly recommended:
- [ ] Contact your embassy (for international couples): international couples should contact their embassy for specific guidance on legal requirements and documentation.
- [ ] Plan for name change (if applicable): if either spouse plans to change their name, understand the necessary procedures and documentation.
