## Setting the budget

Planning a wedding in Poland, especially from abroad, requires a well-structured budget. Keep these key factors in mind:

- **Total budget**: Set a realistic amount, factoring in currency exchange rates and transaction fees—especially if you need the services of a sworn translator (*tłumacz przysięgły*).
- **Essential costs**: Allocate funds for major expenses such as the venue, catering, legal paperwork, travel, and photography.
- **Related costs**: Plan for official translations, notarization, vendor deposits, and last-minute changes. Some payments may require cash or Polish bank transfers.
- **Emergency fund**: Be prepared for unexpected expenses, such as weather contingencies or guest cancellations.
