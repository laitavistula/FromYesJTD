## Last name decisions

In Poland, while it is common for one spouse to adopt the other's surname after marriage, this is not a mandatory requirement. Couples have several legally recognized options regarding surname choices.

### Surname options

Couples may choose from the following surname options:

- **Adoption:** One spouse adopts the other spouse's surname.
- **Retention:** Both spouses retain their respective pre-marriage surnames.
- **Combination:** Both spouses' surnames are combined to form a double-barreled surname. This combined surname can be taken by one or both spouses.

### Legal framework

Any desired surname changes must be formally requested and registered at the Registry office (UrzÄ…d Stanu Cywilnego, USC) at the time of marriage registration.  
Upon processing a name change request, the registry office will issue new official documents reflecting the chosen surname(s).

### Children's surnames

Spouses can also specify the surname(s) of their future children during the marriage registration process.  
If no explicit decision is made regarding children's surnames, children will automatically receive a double-barreled surname upon birth registration.
