## Document authentication

Ensuring the legal validity of foreign documents in Poland requires understanding the processes of apostille or sworn translation, as well as the options and legal framework for last name decisions.

### Apostille (required for Hague Convention countries)

An apostille legalizes documents for use in Poland and abroad. Apostilles are issued by the country where the original document was issued.

In Poland, the authority competent to issue an Apostille is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych).

**To obtain an Apostille, the following general procedure applies:**

1. **Ensure document authenticity:** Verify that the document is an original or a certified copy issued by the appropriate authority.
2. **Prepare the document:** The document may need to be prepared in a specific way, depending on its nature (e.g., official translation, notarization).
3. **Submit the application:** Submit the document and the Apostille application to the relevant authority. This can typically be done in person or by mail.
4. **Processing time:** Processing times vary, so it is advisable to apply well in advance.
5. **Receive the Apostille:** Once processed, the Apostille will be attached to the document.

### Sworn translation (required for non-Hague Convention countries)

Official translations of key documents must be provided by a certified/sworn translator (*tłumacz przysięgły*).
