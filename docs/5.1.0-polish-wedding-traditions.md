# Polish wedding traditions

If you're attending or marrying into a Polish family, these traditions might come up, but they’re not obligatory by any means.  
You and your partner can embrace, modify, or skip them entirely, creating a wedding that celebrates your backgrounds in a way that feels right for you both. Your wedding should feel personal and meaningful to you.

### Pre-wedding and ceremony traditions

Traditional Polish weddings often start with a touching moment - the parental blessing. Both sets of parents wish the couple a life filled with happiness and prosperity. Once the newlyweds arrive at the reception, they are greeted by their parents again, with the traditional offering of bread and salt, symbolizing abundance.  
As part of the festivities, traditional customs might include the groom unveiling the bride’s face, and occasionally playful tests to check if the couple is ready for their new life together.

### Reception essentials

The wedding party follows a structured schedule, typically beginning with a toast and a multi-course dinner.  
**Oczepiny**, a midnight ritual, marks the bride's transition into married life, often involving the tossing of a veil or bouquet. At traditional weddings, the night features folk-inspired dances and games, maintaining high energy well into the morning.

### Poprawiny - the day after party

The day-after party, or **poprawiny**, is a relaxed continuation of the wedding, with additional food, drink, and casual entertainment. Attendance varies: some couples host an open-invitation gathering, while others keep it intimate. Many couples may skip the poprawiny altogether or opt for a brunch-style alternative.

### Regional and family expectations

Poland's diverse regions influence wedding customs, from vodka and food-related rituals in the east to **góralskie** (highlander) traditions in the south. Family involvement can be extensive, with parents and elders playing key roles in organizing and hosting.  
Alcohol is often served generously, with frequent toasts, and guests are prepared for a lengthy celebration.
