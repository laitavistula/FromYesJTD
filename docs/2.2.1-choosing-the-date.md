## Choosing a date

Selecting an appropriate wedding date in Poland requires careful consideration of the right timing. One has to carefully navigate between a calendar filled with national and religious holidays and local superstitions!

Keep these in mind:

- **Symbolic or personal significance**: Choose a date that is meaningful to you and your partner.
- **Weather expectations**: If you're planning an outdoor ceremony, be aware of seasonal weather conditions such as rain, extreme wind, or temperatures.
- **Season and availability**: June, September, and October (the months with an *"r"* in their names in Polish) are the most popular for weddings. Winter weddings may offer more affordable venues and better availability. May and November as wedding months are considered unlucky by some in Poland.

### Holiday and peak season considerations
