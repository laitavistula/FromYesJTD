## Rings
Within the framework of Polish marriage customs, the exchange of wedding rings constitutes a significant element of both religious and civil ceremonies.
### Procedural details:

- **Civil marriages:** the exchange of rings is optional and depends on the couple's preference.
- **Church marriages:** ring exchange is mandatory and the rings are blessed by the officiating priest.
- **Traditional practice:** in Poland, both spouses typically wear the wedding ring on the ring finger of their **right** hand.
- **Ring presentation protocol:** rings are often presented by a designated witness or, in religious settings, a liturgical minister (e.g., ministrant).
- **Legal imperative:** exchanging rings during a civil ceremony is not required for the legal validity of the marriage.
- **Procurement timeline:** it is recommended to order wedding rings at least 2â€“3 months before the wedding date to ensure timely availability.
