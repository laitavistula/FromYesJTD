<summary><strong>Gifts and wedding registries</strong></summary>

In Poland, while monetary gifts in envelopes given during the wedding reception are customary for newlyweds, other forms of gifting are also common.  
Traditionally, guests often bring flowers to the couple, either to the wedding ceremony itself or to the reception venue.  
Guests may also present gifts either after the wedding ceremony or at the wedding reception.  
It is also important to note that some guests may attend only the wedding ceremony and not the subsequent reception.  
Increasingly, couples may include a note in their wedding invitations stipulating specific preferences in lieu of traditional gifts or flowers. This could include requests for specific household items, contributions towards a larger purchase, or donations to a chosen charity. Therefore, it is crucial to clearly communicate any such preferences within the wedding invitation to guide guests.

Hiring vendors who speak both Polish and English (or your native language) ensures clear communication and accurate execution of your vision of the wedding reception.  
Select vendors who demonstrate cultural awareness and willingness to accommodate various dietary needs, ensuring all guests feel included and respected.

When managing cross-border payments, be aware of currency exchange fees and international transaction charges.  
Services such as Revolut offer competitive exchange rates and reduced fees for international transfers.  
While non-residents may face challenges opening traditional bank accounts in Poland, digital banking services provide flexible solutions for managing finances without requiring a local account.
