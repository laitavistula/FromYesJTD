## Witnesses

At least two witnesses (sing. *świadek*, pl. *świadkowie*) who have reached 18 years of age must be present at any marriage ceremony.

The selection of witnesses is a critical procedural step. It is advisable to identify and formally request individuals to serve as witnesses well in advance of the ceremony date.

> **Refer to the section [Legal requirements > Witnesses](3.4.3-witnesses.md)** for detailed information regarding witness documentation and responsibilities.
