## Disclaimer on inclusivity

The current Polish legal framework defines marriage as a union entered voluntarily by a man and a woman of legal marriageable age (18), neither of whom is currently married and who are not related.

Poland recognizes:
- **Civil ceremonies** performed by state officials  
- **Religious ceremonies** with civil effects  
- **Qualified international marriages**

While legal marriage options are limited, couples can arrange **symbolic ceremonies**, **commitment ceremonies**, or **private reception events**. Many wedding service providers—including venues, caterers, and event planners—accommodate a variety of celebrations and support diverse couples.
