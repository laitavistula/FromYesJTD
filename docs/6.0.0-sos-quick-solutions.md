<summary>What to do if documents are delayed</summary>

Delays in paperwork are not uncommon, particularly for international couples.  
If key documents are delayed (such as the marriage certificate or translations), contact the relevant <strong>Register office</strong> (<em>Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC</em>) or your embassy for guidance.  
Having a backup marriage date in case of unexpected delays can save stress. Working with a local translator or legal expert can fast-track the process.

<summary>Backup plans for translation issues</summary>

Translation issues can arise if a document is incorrectly translated or lacks necessary certification.  
Ensure all translations are handled by sworn translators (<em>tłumacz przysięgły</em>), recognized by the government. If something goes wrong, have additional copies of the translations ready to submit.  
For urgent situations, inquire with the wedding venue and local <strong>Register office</strong> (<em>Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC</em>) about the possibility of temporary acceptance of certified translations or notarized verification of translations.
