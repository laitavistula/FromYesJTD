# The wedding day

## Overview: Timeline and schedule

Polish weddings often begin with separate morning preparations for the couple, though some choose to get ready together. The parental blessing usually takes place at the brideâ€™s home, where close family members offer their good wishes. Makeup and hair are often done early, as Polish weddings start early in the afternoon.

The ceremony, civil or religious, typically takes place in the early afternoon. In civil weddings, the couple arrives together at the registry office, while in church weddings, customs vary: some couples walk down the aisle together, while others follow the Western tradition of the father escorting the bride.

## What to expect at a Polish wedding ceremony?

### Civil Ceremony

- Lasts 20-30 minutes  
- Includes legal vows, ring exchange, and signing of the marriage certificate

### Religious Ceremony

- Catholic wedding: lasts about an hour, and includes a mass with hymns, readings, and a formal vow exchange  
- Protestant, Orthodox, and Ecumenical weddings: vary by denomination but follow religious traditions

Regardless of the ceremony type, it is customary for guests to greet the newlyweds outside the venue by tossing rice, coins, or flower petals.
