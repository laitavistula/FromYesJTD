## Witnesses

At any wedding ceremony in Poland, two witnesses are required. Each witness must be at least 18 years old.

### Civil and Concordat Weddings

- Witnesses must present valid identification documents (e.g., national ID or passport).

### Church Weddings

- Tradition suggests choosing religious witnesses of different genders as role models for the couple, though this is not a strict requirement.
- Witnesses must be at least 18 years old and have valid identification.
- Witnesses, along with the couple, sign the marriage certificate, typically in the sacristy before the ceremony.
- It is traditional for witnesses to be able to participate in confession and communion, but this is not mandatory.
- Witnesses do not need to be of the same denomination as the church where the wedding takes place or to have received confirmation.

### Humanist Weddings

- Witnesses are not legally required at the humanist ceremony since the legal marriage signing occurs at the civil ceremony at the Register office (UrzÄ…d Stanu Cywilnego, USC).
- However, couples may choose to have witnesses present for symbolic purposes.
